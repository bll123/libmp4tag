### Writing Tags

The MP4 file is not modified until the __mp4tag_write_tags__ function is
called.

If possible, the MP4 file is modified in-place.  If there is not
enough room for the modified tags, the MP4 file is re-written and
replaced.

Determining whether any tags have changed and whether calling
__mp4tag_write_tags__ is necessary is the responsibility of the
application.
