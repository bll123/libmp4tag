### Writing Tags

The MP4 file is not modified until the **mp4tag_write_tags** function is
called.

If possible, the MP4 file is modified in-place.  If there is not
enough room for the modified tags, the MP4 file is re-written and
replaced.

Determining whether any tags have changed and whether calling
**mp4tag_write_tags** is necessary is the responsibility of the
application.

##### mp4tag_write_tags

~~~
int mp4tag_write_tags (libmp4tag_t *libmp4tag)
~~~

**libmp4tag** : The libmp4tag_t structure returned from mp4tag_open.

Returns: MP4TAG_OK or other [error&nbsp;code](ErrorCodes).
