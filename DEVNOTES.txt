Build requirements:
  make
  cmake
  C compiler
  libmp4tag does not use any external libraries.

What I need:

  Sample files with tags.
  Especially if the program can't handle them.
  Especially if there's something less common in them.

Windows build uses MSys2.
I don't use the MicroSoft C compilers.
Any testing and changes, project file are appreciated.
